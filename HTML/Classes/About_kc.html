   <h2 id="h2">Early Life</h2>
   <p id="early_life">
    Born in Karnal, India, on March 17, 1962, to parents Banarasi Lal Chawla and Sanjyothi Chawla, Kalpana Chawla was the youngest of four children. 
   </p>
   
   <p>Until she started school, Chawla hadn't been formally named. Her parents called her Montu, but Chawla picked her own name from a selection when she entered education. The name Kalpana means "idea" or "imagination." Her full name is pronounced CULL-pah-na CHAU-la, though she often went by the nickname K.C.
  <br>
    As a child, Chawla developed an interest in flying after first seeing a plane at around the age of three. She spent days with her father visiting her local flying club with her father and showed an interest in aviation while at school. </p>

    <h2 id="h2">Education</h2>
    <p id="edu">
        During her earlier education in India, Chawla attended Tagore Baal Niketan Senior Secondary School, Karnal. 
<br><br>
Chawla obtained a degree in aeronautical engineering from Punjab Engineering College. When selecting the course, professors tried to dissuade her, as there were limited opportunities for girls in India following this career path. However, Chawla was adamant that this was the subject for her.
<br><br>
After completing her engineering degree in India, Chawla immigrated to the United States in the 1980s and became a naturalized citizen to continue her studies. She obtained her masters degree from the University of Texas and earned a doctorate in aerospace engineering from the University of Colorado in 1988.
<br><br>
Chawla began working at NASA's Ames Research Center the same year, working on powered-lift computational fluid dynamics. In particular, her work focused on understanding how air flows around an aircraft during flight and incorporating computers into the work.

    <h2 id="h2">Astronaut Career</h2>
       <p id="career">Kalpana Chawla, an Indian-American astronaut and aerospace engineer, had a remarkable career at NASA:
        <br><br>
        git 
       <b>Joining NASA: </b>  Selected in 1994, Chawla reported to the Johnson Space Center in 1995 as part of the 15th Astronaut Group [National Air and Space Museum]. <br>
        Training and Early Work: After a year of training, she served as a crew representative on technical issues for the Astronaut Office [National Air and Space Museum]. This involved developing tools for astronauts to better understand robotic situations and testing space shuttle software.
        <br><br>
        <b>First Space Mission (STS-87): </b> In 1997, Chawla's historic first mission arrived. She was a mission specialist and the primary robotic arm operator aboard the Space Shuttle Columbia on STS-87. During this 16-day mission, the crew conducted various experiments with a focus on material science.  This mission made her the first Indian-born woman to fly in space.
    
        <br><br>
        
        <b>Between Missions: </b>Chawla became a crew representative for shuttle and station flight crew equipment and later led the Astronaut Office's Crew Systems and Habitability section [National Air and Space Museum]. 
        <br><br>
        <b>Second Mission and Legacy (STS-107): </b> In 2003, Chawla tragically perished aboard the Space Shuttle Columbia during its re-entry into Earth's atmosphere on the STS-107 mission. This mission was the final flight of Columbia. Despite her life being cut short, her bravery and accomplishments continue to inspire future generations, especially young girls in India and around the world to pursue careers in science and space exploration </p>

    <h2 id="h2">Space Mission And Death</h2>
    <p id="m_d">
        Kalpana Chawla's final mission was also, unfortunately, the one that ended her life. Here's a breakdown of the mission and the tragedy: 
        <br><br>

<b>Mission: </b> STS-107, the final flight of the Space Shuttle Columbia, launched in January 2003. It was a 16-day scientific research mission where the crew conducted over 80 experiments in various fields [National Air and Space Museum].
<br><br>

<b>The Disaster: </b>During re-entry on February 1, 2003, tragedy struck.  Earlier on takeoff, a piece of foam insulation had broken off and struck the Columbia's wing. The damage wasn't noticed at the time. However, upon re-entry, the damaged area allowed hot atmospheric gases to breach the wing, causing the spacecraft to break apart tragically over Texas. Sadly, all seven crew members, including Kalpana Chawla, perished in the disaster.
<br><br>
<b>Legacy: </b>The Columbia disaster grounded the Space Shuttle program for over two years to investigate the cause and implement safety improvements.  Despite the heartbreaking loss, Kalpana Chawla's life and achievements continue to inspire future generations of scientists and astronauts, particularly young women in STEM fields.
